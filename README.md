dotfiles
========

My vim and git config files. Some of it is customized around my system setup (like aliases pointing to paths) but you should be able to easily remove that stuff.

Installing
==========

Installation is done via Rake. Just run

    rake install
    
This will create symlinks in your home folder to the various dotfiles in this repo.
