## Keyboard Remapping

* Remap caps lock to ctrl
    * After running the install script, open the Karabiner-Elements app, then go to preferences->Simple
      modifications and add a new item that maps `caps_lock` to `left_control`.

* Remap caps lock to esc on tap and ctrl on hold
    * After running the install script, follow this guide starting at step 2: https://web.archive.org/web/20200513031048/https://medium.com/@pechyonkin/how-to-map-capslock-to-control-and-escape-on-mac-60523a64022b
    * Note: I had some issues with vim sometimes losing the caps lock remap. I just went with the
      simple caps->ctrl remap.
